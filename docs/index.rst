PerturbedHalos: Accurate Models for Matter Power Spectra and Cluster Covariances
=================================================================================

PerturbedHalos is a fast Python code providing models of the real-space matter power spectrum, based a combination of the Halo Model and Effective Field Theory, which are 1\% accurate up to :math:`k = 1\,h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}`. It can additionally compute accurate the covariance between halo counts and the matter power spectrum.

This is based on the work of Philcox, Spergel \& Villaescusa-Navarro (in prep.), and is built on the CLASS code.
