# PerturbedHalos
PerturbedHalos is a fast Python code providing models of the real-space matter power spectrum, based a combination of the Halo Model and Effective Field Theory, which are 1\% accurate up to k = 1 h/Mpc. It can additionally compute accurate the covariance between halo counts and the matter power spectrum.

This is based on the work of Philcox, Spergel \& Villaescusa-Navarro (in prep.)
